# Project_Pomodoro_Timer

The Pomodoro Timer Project is an application in which it allows the users to be alerted with a sound when the focus timer(the pomodoro) expires. 
It is followed by a break timer which gives the user a short interval to take a break from work. 

Users can change the duration of the focus time (default: 25 minutes) and the break time(default: 5 minutes). 
Focus duration can be as short as 5 minutes, and as long as 60 minutes. Break duration can be as short as 1 minute, and as long as 15 minutes.
